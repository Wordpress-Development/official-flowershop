## Installing WordPressTheme with Sample Data
www.officialtheme.com

Guide for installing Wordpress with Sample Data so that you can make your website exactly as you see on demo.officialtheme.com.

Why? Because it will save you lots of time with configuration and customizations as you will have already everything set-up.

IMPORTANT: Do not use the Sample Data if you already have a running WordPress website. If that is the case, install only our theme and ajust the settings accordially. 
TIP in this case: We reccomend that you install the Sample Data on a test envirioment on your localhost, just to see the settings and configuraitons we have done.


### Step 1
Download the latest copy of WordPress and install it either in your localhost
or on your live web server (Please follow the instructions from
WordPress on how to install it)


### Step 2
Install theme package "official-flowershop.(version).zip" as following:

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.


### Step 3
Install the following plugins in the admin panel > plugins

To easily install all plugins at once, install first the plugin below (make sure you active it) "Multi Plugin Installer" by By Nishant Jain, rahulbrilliant2004, tikendramaitry

Open the "Multi Plugin Installer" that you have just installed from the menu on the left and enter the following list to install all plugins at once.


```
BAW Login/Logout menu
Contact Form 7
Custom Classes
Display Widgets
Huge IT Portfolio Gallery
MailChimp for WordPress
Media Library Categories
Remove Widget Titles
Shortcode Widget
Shortcodes Ultimate
Smart Slider 3
Widget CSS Classes
Widget Importer Exporter
Widget Logic
WooCommerce
WooCommerce Menu Cart
WordPress Importer
WP Fastest Cache
WP Maintenance Mode
XO10 - WooCommerce Categories widget
```

Notice: if a plugin is not installed, please install it manually 


### Step 4
Now it is time to import the sample data into your WordPress site.

Again, it is important to notice that if you already have a running WordPress site, (you have posts and pages you wish to keep) dont install the sample data files as they may replace your current data.

1. In your admin panel go to "Tools > Import > Wordpres"
Import this file "official-flowershop.wordpress.(date-is-here).xml"
(Make sure you select 'Download and import file attachments') from the next step.

2. In your admin panel go to "Apperance > Widgets" and delete all default widgets that are currently positioned on any of theme wigets area (we will update with new ones). 
Now, go to "Tools > Widget Importer & Exporter" and From the Import option upload this file "official-flowershop.widgets.(date-is-here).wie". 

3. In your admin panel go to "Smart Slider" and find the "Import slider from different sources" and upload this file "Smart-Slider.(date-is-here).ss3"


### Step 5
Now it is time to adjust all your Theme settings as those found on our Demo site. We are mentioning only those settings that are required but you are welcome to adjust all of them based on your project needs.

In your admin panel go to "Apperance > Customize"

- Logo (select your logo image, or use our Demo theme logo which is already on the media library)
- Social Media Icons (select up to 6 social media icons images or select the ones that are already on the media library)
- Hide frontpage Content (select yes)
- Slider Background (select an image from your own or you may use the theme's one from the media library)
-  Accepted Cards Image (select your own image or you may use the theme's one from the media library)
-  Menus > Menu Locations and select "Primary > Primary Menu" and "Topmenu > Top Menu"
