## Installation
In case you already have a running WordPress site then follow this simple steps to install only our Theme, but if you are starting your website from scratch, we strongly recommend that you use "Installing with Sample Data" guide below (make your website exactly as our Demo)

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
4. In your admin panel, go to "Appearance > Customize" and adjust the settings based on your needs. Required here is to select under  "Menus > Menu Locations" the corresponding menus which are "Primary > Primary Menu" and "Topmenu > Top Menu"

TIP: We recommend that you install WordPress with our Sample Data from the below guide on a test environment (e.g localhost), so you can see the settings and configurations we have done, and apply those on your live website.


## Installing with Sample Data
In case you want to make your WordPress website exactly as you see on our Demo, please follow the steps below (Step 1-5).

Why Sample Data? Because it will save you lots of time with configuration and customizations as you will have already everything pre-setup.

**IMPORTANT:** Do not use the Sample Data if you already have a running WordPress website. If that is the case, install only our theme and adjust the settings manually. 


#### Step 1
Download the latest copy of WordPress and install it either in your localhost
or on your live web server (Please follow the instructions from
WordPress on how to install it)


#### Step 2
Install theme package "official-flowershop.(version).zip" as following:

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.


#### Step 3
Install the following plugins in the admin panel > plugins

To easily install all plugins at once, please install first 
"Multi Plugin Installer" by By Nishant Jain, rahulbrilliant2004, tikendramaitry
Make sure you have activated it.

Open the "Multi Plugin Installer" from the menu on the left and enter the following list to install all plugins at once.


```
BAW Login/Logout menu
Contact Form 7
Custom Classes
Customizer Export/Import
Display Widgets
Huge IT Portfolio Gallery
MailChimp for WordPress
Media Library Categories
Remove Widget Titles
Shortcode Widget
Shortcodes Ultimate
Smart Slider 3
Widget CSS Classes
Widget Importer Exporter
Widget Logic
WooCommerce
WooCommerce Menu Cart
WordPress Importer
WP Fastest Cache
WP Maintenance Mode
XO10 - WooCommerce Categories widget
```


**Notice 1:** if a plugin from the list above was not installed, please install it manually by going in admin panel > plugins. 
(After some test we noticed that only "Custom Classes" plugin failed to install, if so please search for "Custom Classes by Justin Tadlock") 

**Notice 2:** We noticed that "Smart Slider 3" plugin failed to show correctly. If that is the case, simply go to your admin panel > Plugins, and deactivate "Smart Slider 3" and activate again. It will solve the issue and you will be able to see this plugin on the admin menu on the left.


#### Step 4
Now, we will import the Sample Data into your WordPress site. 

**The Sample-Data files can be found inside our theme package, under the "sample-data" folder directory.**

Again, it is important to notice that if you already have a running WordPress site, (you have posts and pages you wish to keep) do not install the sample data files as they may replace your current data.

a. **Import Wordpress Sample Data** 
In your admin panel go to "Tools > Import > WordPress"
Import this file "official-flowershop.wordpress.(date-is-here).xml"
**Notice:** Make sure you select "Download and import file attachments" when importing, to import all media. Also, the import may take a couple of minutes.

b. **Import Widgets**
In your admin panel go to "Apperance > Widgets" and delete all default widgets that are currently positioned on any of widgets area. 
Go to "Tools > Widget Importer & Exporter" and From the Import option upload this file "official-flowershop.widgets.(date-is-here).wie". 

c. **Import Smart Slider 3 Sample Data**
In your admin panel go to "Smart Slider" and find the "Import slider from different sources" and upload this file "Smart-Slider.(date-is-here).ss3"


#### Step 5
Now it is time to adjust all your Theme settings as those found on our Demo site. We are mentioning only those settings that are required but you are welcome to adjust all of them based on your project needs.

In your admin panel go to "Apperance > Customize"

- Logo (select your logo image, or use our Demo theme logo which is already on the media library)
- Social Media Icons (select up to 6 social media icons images or select the ones that are already on the media library)
- Hide frontpage Content (select yes)
- Slider Background (select an image from your own or you may use the theme's one from the media library)
-  Accepted Cards Image (select your own image or you may use the theme's one from the media library)
-  Menus > Menu Locations and select "Primary > Primary Menu" and "Topmenu > Top Menu"


## Customization
Basically there are two ways to customize our theme:

1. **Child Themes (recommended)** (tutorial coming soon). For the moment please follow [This Link](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/) to learn more how to create a new child theme.

2. **Edit LESS/CSS only (optional)** This option works only if you plan to edit or add only CSS or LESS styles and not needing to alter any other part. Simply create a new file called 'custom.less' inside the 'css/less' folder (main theme folder, not the child one) and add your Less styles there (or just CSS for that matter). If you are not familiar with LESS-CSS, you may create a new file called 'custom.css' inside the 'css' folder and add your CSS styles there
